								<b>This Personal Website!</b><br> I created this website by first forking a template from https://html5up.net/ , and changing it
								to be unique to me. I went through the text and tried to understand the function of all the code and how it altered the 
								site. I also completed the FreeCodeCamp 'Basic HTML and HTML5' walk through to help my understanding.

								<b>Language:</b> Python for now! I chose this coding language because it is most used in the ISAT major and I feel as though whatever job I get 
								in the future will benefit from at least a little knowledge of this. I am also interested in more social connections with the topics I am 
								passionate about, so JavaScript could be fun to explore near the end of the semester if I have time.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Weekly Challenges:</b> I want to complete at least 2 challenges a week on different platforms like Hackerrank and some of the FreeCodeCamp
								tutorials that will help boost my knowledge.
							
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Passion Project:</b> I am interested in STS topics, biotechnology, climate change, social justice and music with meaning... I want to 
								try to combine some of those to produce some code that does somthing in relation to those. Maybe a program that recommends you songs based
								on these ideas and current events.
